                    <h1>ComfortBot Discord Bot</h1>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        ComfortBot is a WIP Discord Bot I'm currently developing.
                        As such, its functionality is limited right now; however, 
                        I've attached instructions and a view into its testing
                        server so anyone can try out its easy-to-display commands
                        and features. As ComfortBot is updated, it's very likely a 
                        changelog will be added to this page, keeping track of exactly 
                        what features were added when. The current plan is to create three 
                        major features before any public release: the YouTube audio player 
                        (already functional but needs some tweaking and additional support), 
                        a mid-level calculator set of commands, and a word definition search.
                        The goal with ComfortBot is to create ease-of-access to various media
                        and information, so users don't need to be leaving Discord or streaming
                        to show each other something. Updates past these features will reflect
                        that goal as well.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="container reactive-element">
                    <h1>Testing Instructions</h1>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        1. ComfortBot should already be online, and the viewport on the right 
                        should allow you to login to Discord or simply give yourself a nickname. 
                        If it's not working, it's likely a server issue with the bot itself, so 
                        please come try it again at a later date!
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        2. You should be able to test any available commands ComfortBot has 
                        been given. Note that because of the limited viewport, audio commands
                        aren't testable, but any text command should be visibly functional.
                        To get started, type "$help" to get a list of ComfortBot's current commands.
                        NOTE: As of now, ComfortBot's text commands are VERY limited. It's also 
                        being moved to a different hosting platform, so it may be unavailable here 
                        to test for some time.
