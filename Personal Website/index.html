<!--This is the homepage, so it will be a basic starting point and intro
    for this as a personal website, will contain mostly just info and 
    background on me. For the website overall, I wanted to go with a minimalist
    feel, especially due to the fact I don't have a ton to put on it yet. As time
    goes on and I add more to the site, the complexity might significantly increase,
    but for now the site's pretty simple and functional.-->

                    I wanted to add some kind of responsive element to the page, so I made a CSS
                    class that lights up and almost provides a shadow to areas you're viewing. It's
                    essentially the same as the navbar buttons' hover, which I'm still conflicted
                    about. I like this idea, I just feel like I need a way to make it similar but 
                    still noticeably different from the navbar hover-->

                        I move into the CS field, I could talk more about what experience I have and
                        what I enjoy, or anything else that's a little less identifying, for lack of

                        Hey! My name's Elijah, and I'm currently a senior
                        in UW Bothell's undergraduate Computer Science &
                        Software Engineering program. I'm pursuing the additional
                        Information Assurance & Cybersecurity option with my degree,
                        and am hoping to eventually move into the field of cybersecurity
                        engineering. I spend my free time listening to music, hanging 
                        with friends, and going on the occasional hike. I love dogs and 
                        volunteer weekly at my local shelter.
