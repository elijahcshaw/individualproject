<!--DESCRIPTION:
    This page is pretty simple, and will just contain links and maybe some guidelines (lol)
    for reaching out to me if someone really wanted to. I'm a pretty private person when it
    comes to personal info and connections, so I'm gonna have to find a balance of actually
    having something on this page without feeling uncomfortable with the amount of info shared.-->
<!--PURPOSE:
    This page exists to add ability to contact or connect with me if an employer or other 
    individual really wanted to. Its more abstract purpose is to practice balancing discretion
    of personal info with realistic ability to contact me.-->

                        on Spotify! I don't check my followers all the time but if 
                        you add me there's a good chance I'll add you back even if
                        it takes a bit. I've got quite a few playlists for certain artists'
                        best work as well, so if you've never listened to one of them before
                        you should give those a shot!
